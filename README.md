# Robotics Projects with TurtleBot and Burger Robots in ROS

This repository contains implementations of various robotics tasks using ROS, TurtleBot, and Burger robots. The projects include object tracking, escape plans, PID controller implementation, and creating geometric shapes like stars.

## Overview
The project demonstrates the following tasks:
- **Object Tracker**: Tracks moving objects using YOLO on camera data.
- **Escape Plan**: Implements a strategy for the robot to navigate out of confined spaces.
- **PID Controller**: Controls the robot's movements with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) algorithm.
- **Shape Creator**: A task that enables the robot to create geometric shapes, including stars.
